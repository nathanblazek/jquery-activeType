# Welcome to ActiveType Markdown Parser!
## By Nathan Blazek
Thank you for checking out my plugin. I created this plugin for a personal project of mine located at [my personal web site](http://www.nateblazek.com)...eventually!
### Goals
1. Actively parse markdown and display it on the webpage as a user updates it.
12. Process markdown by using basic regex
33. Get better at using regex..**I suck at it**, I really do. I use it very periodically and I never get held up by it, but I do not feel confident enough to use it without the help of [Google](http://www.google.com) or online test sites like [Regex101](http://www.regex101.com)
3. Allow Regex to be passed into the plugin. This, at it's core, was a requirement of mine. I want to store markdown in a table, parsing it server side to deliver onto a webpage. Rewriting regex didnt sound like fun and I hate code duplication. Allowing regex to be passed into this plugin solves my concerns.

### Markdown Logic
> The markdown sample can be taken from this README.md file. This is standard markdown code, commonly used in github projects.

`If you want to use code, you'd put it in a block of text like this and it would not get rendered on output. <strong> SEE!</strong>`
